## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

This projects SQL Data Warehoues was implemented by the Instructor [Data with Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&t=1258s) on youtube that allow me to understand about Data Warehousing which are organizing, structuring and preparing  raw of datasets. 
### In the Data Warehousing Stage, I implement a series of step:
- **ETL/ELT Processing**
- **Data Architecture**
- **Data Integration**
- **Data Cleansing**
- **Data Load**
- **Data Modeling**

### To do this stage, we follows a Medallion Architecture
Medallion Architecture a data design pattern that organizes data into three hierarchical layers to progressively improve data quality and usability within a lakehouse environment. The hierarchical layers are:
-- **Bronze (raw data)**
-- **Silver (cleaned data)**
-- **Gold (business-ready data)**
